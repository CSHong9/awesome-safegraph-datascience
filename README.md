## What is SafeGraph?

SafeGraph is a data company! The coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has brought massive and ongoing changes, including to how people interact with their surroundings and participate in the economy. SafeGraph, committed to open access to information, has created a dashboard to share insights daily into how the economy is re-opening up, and how America is returning to a new normal.
